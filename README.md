# BCH-10-6-GeneratingAndCorrecting
Application for generating and correcting BCH (10,6) code

###Generating and Correcting app for the BCH(10,6) code

##Task

Build an application that can be used for generating and correcting BCH(10,6) code.

##Summary 

This application was built using Netbeans with Jframe. Netbeans comes with JAVA programming language which allows me to implement the back-end of the application based on the principle of object oriented programming such as treating each module as an object and each functionality as a method within the class. Jframe was also used for implementing this application, the user interface and layout were all designed using Jframe for linking all the functionality from the back-end with the front-end of the application.

##Functionality

This application allows the users to generating BCH(10,6) code by inputting 6 digits. It also can be used for correcting BCH (10,6) code by inputting 10 digits.

##Design

The design of this application followed the basic pattern of regular application such that it has interface with clearly intructions on how to use it, every buttons has it own label describes what is it and the application has an error handling functionality that display an error messages when the user raised some errors.   

##Run Locally

- Clone the folder BCH-10-6-GeneratingAndCorrecting
- Make sure to install Netbeans
- Run the jar file \BCH-10-6-GeneratingAndCorrecting\BCHGeneratingAndCorrecting.jar
- Optionally, the application can be run by using Netbeans then run the file \BCH-10-6-GeneratingAndCorrecting\src\BCH\BCHGenAndCorrect.JAVA
